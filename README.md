A Silly App
-----------

This app is composed of three modules.  Each module is a separate
Maven artifact.  Each module is versioned and released separately.
The app has a parent POM that puts the modules together.  The
parent POM (the entire app itself) is also versioned and released
separately.

The revision history represents a possible approach for this
versioning and releasing.
